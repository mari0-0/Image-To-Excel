This File contains the code to convert an image to an excel spreadsheet,

from PIL import Image

'''
This function will take in an image name/path, read in the image's rgb data for it's pixels, and then write these pixels to an excel spreadsheet,
To create this effect is will read the rgb data, and then color 3 cells in the spreadsheet to match. So there will be 1 red cell, 1 green cell and 1 blue cell
in the spreadsheet for every pixel. The magnitude of the individual colors will reflect the intensity of the rgb data and when viewed at a good scale will make the spreadsheet
look like the image. 


it has 2 optional arguments, resolution controls how detailed the excel image will be, a value of 1 means for every row/column there will be a dedicated row/column
a value less than 1 means that it will skip over some pixels (i.e. resolution = .5 means there will be only half as many 'pixels' in the resulting spreadsheet)
